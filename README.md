This is a fork with additionnal functionnality and fixes of the software
originally distributed by Brian Schkerke and available at
https://github.com/talonius/hb-downloader

This repository contains code from Joel Pedraza's awesome humblebundle-python
library, available at https://github.com/saik0/humblebundle-python

## Requirements
* Python 3.6
* requests library
* pyyaml library

## Python Installation
Several features particular to Python v3.6 might have been used during the development of this script.  To install Python v3.6 visit https://www.python.org/downloads/ and grab the latest 3.x.x release.

## Getting the Prerequisites
From a command prompt, enter:

    pip install requests
    pip install pyyaml

You'll either be informed that the requirement is already satisfied, or pip will retrieve, install, and configure the libraries for you.

## Getting the Installation Files
* Download the zip file from the releases page and unzip it to the directory of your choice.
* Check out the source with Git:  `git clone git://github.com/MayeulC/hb-downloader.git`

## Installation
Firstly, clone the repository or download it as a zip and extract it. You then
need to fetch your authentication cookie from humblebundle.com.  To do so,
navigate there, log in and press F12 to open the developper tools of your
browser. Navigate to the cookies tab, and look for a cookie named
`_simple_auth` (on the humblebundle.com domain). Copy the value inside the
`hb-downloader-settings.yaml` file, or specify it on the command line with the
"-c" flag. Pay attention that every character is correctly escaped according to
the method you choose.

`hb-downloader-settings.yaml` is the configuration file for the script.  It
contains all of the information that can be overridden during script execution
trough the command line interface. The format (for the data we're concerned
with) is:
 
     <variable name>: <variable value>

download-location is where you want the files to be stored during and after
their download from humblebundle.com.  This location needs to exist and be
writable by the user executing the script.  It can be a Linux style directory
(`/mnt/Mila/Games/Humble Bundle`), a UNC share
(`\\megatron\mila\games\humble bundle`) or a Windows drive reference
(`C:\Users\Username\Downloads`):

    download-location:  \\megatron\mila\games\humble bundle

## Issues
If you encounter any issues or have suggestions, please [open an issue](https://github.com/MayeulC/hb-downloader/issues) on GitHub.

## Known Issues
If you run the script in a terminal window under Windows you may receive:

     UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode character...
     
This only happens if you have an extended character in the name of one of your products.  The easiest fix is to export an environment variable so that Python knows the terminal can accept Unicode:

    set PYTHONIOENCODING=UTF-8
